## Nicole Beller: GAM-495 Capstone

![Nicole Beller](https://github.com/NicBee/NicBee.github.io/blob/master/NicoleBeller.png?raw=true "Nicole Beller")

My name is Nicole Beller; I am a gamer, a military spouse, a mother to two wonderful boys, a daydreamer, and a soon-to-be college graduate. I have attended Southern New Hampshire University for the past 3 years and am in the Game Programming and Development degree program. I have learned how to program in multiple different languages (Java, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ActionScript), learned various design and gaming programs (Unreal Engine 4, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Animate, Adobe Illustrator, Bitbucket, SourceTree, GitHub, 3DS Max, Mudbox, Brackets, Android Studio) and maintained a 3.9 grade point average throughout my entire academic career. I am obsessed with cats, colors, storytelling, and lore and I have a passion for entertaining people. I embrace being an oddball and standing out from the crowd.

All of the artifacts in my ePortfolio show specific aspects of my game programming and development skills. My first artifact, ­The Race, shows that I have an understanding of how gamers’ minds work; most gamers want to be challenged and in this game there are multiple different difficulties, which appeals to diverse target audiences; with each difficulty comes a new map with unique set of rules to further set apart each difficulty. The inclusion of this artifact was necessary because the other games in my ePortfolio only have one map and one difficulty and there are no time limits. 

My second artifact, Paintball_Fiasco, is more relaxed and aimed toward the younger gaming generation. With this game, players are allowed to roam from one section of the map to the other, making messes and chasing after AI. The primary reason why this game had to be included in my ePortfolio is that it shows off my programming capabilities; within this game, aside from the AI, I had programmed nearly every object the player sees and interacts with. I specifically designed my triangles to point in odd directions and created steps and cubes specifically for this paintball game. Paintball_Fiasco and The Race complement each other because they are primarily program-based games but feel completely different with separate goals in mind.

The Imaginarium, my third artifact, was one of the games I was most proud of and there was no doubt in my mind that I would be showing it off in my ePortfolio. I worked extremely hard on this game, making the tone of the game feel light and heavy at the same time, keeping Sam’s sexual orientation ambiguous, and adding comedic affects like specific audio or the video that triggers when the player wins the game; I also worked hard on keeping my team together, despite all of our distinctive ideas and unique personalities. For this game, I worked on a team and I know I did more than my fair share of the work to ensure that our game was successful. With this game, I learned that I have an interest in working on UI elements and I believe this game shows off my abilities with making appealing HUDs and menus. I wanted this game to feel like an indie team worked on it, so I went out of my way to manipulate the level layout to get the perfect title screen. 

My dream is to become a video game writer and my ePortfolio needed something that showed my writing capabilities, which is why my graphic design project Bandit’s Endeavour was added. All of my games were focused on gameplay or level layout and I needed something to prove that I have what it takes to become a game writer. There’s also a fine line of user interactivity within this animation, which breaks the fourth wall, further accentuating the need for this artifact addition to my ePortfolio. The storytelling in this animation shows comedic and dark undertones, possessiveness, depression, hope, understanding and acceptance, and hidden meanings; there’s tension, plot, climax, and character development, all within a four-minute video. 

When looking at my artifacts in the specific order I arranged them, I believe you can see an improvement from each one. With the first artifact, I showed my programming talents and interest in challenging players. With the second artifact, I further demonstrated my programming talents and level design abilities. With the third artifact, I showed some of my comedic personality, my understanding of target audiences, and my UI talents. Finally, with my fourth artifact, I showed my storytelling and cleverness through the use of objects having a greater meaning than originally thought of and displayed my understanding of how to captivate an audience and make them cheer for the undercat.

# Refined Artifact #1 - *The Race*
![The Race](https://github.com/NicBee/NicBee.github.io/blob/master/TheRace_6.jpg?raw=true "The Race")

I created *The Race* in November of 2018 and completed the quick game in December of 2018. It was intended to be my final assignment for my GAM-312 class, Scripting for Games, but I had enjoyed working on it so much that I decided to return to it for my capstone class.

In *The Race*, the goal is to find and collect the hidden items within the level before the mindless AI steal them. There are different kinds of AI, with some running to randomized places and others running around in circles and there are multiple levels with various difficulties; some levels are timed while others are more geared toward exploring. Along with the hidden items are decoy items that will challenge the player into thinking they should go a certain way only to find out that the item was a mirage, allowing the AI more time to steal the real items.

# Refined Artifact #2 - *Paintball_Fiasco*
![Paintball_Fiasco](https://github.com/NicBee/NicBee.github.io/blob/master/Paintball_Fiasco_.jpg?raw=true "Paintball_Fiasco")

*Paintball_Fiasco* is a simple paintball game that I created for my GAM-415 Graphics Game Engine course through February and April of 2019. The game objective is to make as big of a paintball mess as possible. There is no 'win scenario' and it’s more so used to vent frustrations by shooting colorful paintballs all over the place. Players can shoot black walls, animated and non-animated targets, and can shoot while jumping on a trampoline. The goal of the game was to make something fun for my son, who is six years old, to enjoy and not worry about losing.

# Refined Artifact #3 - *The Imaginarium*
![The Imaginarium](https://github.com/NicBee/NicBee.github.io/blob/master/TheImaginarium_.JPG?raw=true "The Imaginarium")

*The Imaginarium* is a 3D adventure single-player game. The game is about a child named Sam who needs to pick up and put away his toys but with each toy collected Sam becomes bored and begins to daydream. When Sam’s imagination runs wild, they believe they’re in a castle instead and that they need to navigate their way over the lava pits and jump puzzles, fight the bad guys, and find the hidden keys to open the locked doors.  Once they pass all of their challenges, they can return the toy to the chest, which will kick them out of their imagination and bring them back to the real world.

*The Imaginarium* was created by Team (Pizz)A, which consisted of 6 individuals; each individual had their role on the team, with me being the primary main character programmer and the UI programmer, along with finding and utilizing the various audio cues and I was the occasional QA.  Under the guidance of our GAM-305 (Digital Game Development) professor, we won the competition that he had started that term in January and February of 2019.

# Refined Artifact #4 - *Bandit's Endeavour*
![Bandit's Endeavour](https://github.com/NicBee/NicBee.github.io/blob/master/Bandits_Endeavour_8.jpg?raw=true "Bandit's Endeavour")

I created this Flash animation in the spring of 2018 (March - April) and I didn't revisit it until October of 2019.  I created this animation for my GRA-211 Interactive Animation course and I always believed I would return to it because I  thoroughly enjoyed working on it.  I also enjoyed knowing that I was using a program that some well-known animated sitcoms were created with.

*Bandit's Endeavour* is an animation about a feline who hates his life.  Mistreated and neglected, Bandit aimlessly waits for a time when he can escape.  Eventually, the lovely Shiloh approaches Bandit with an offer.  Watch as Bandit and Shiloh team up and escape from the Crazy Cat Lady's lair.
