## Nicole Beller: GAM-495 Capstone

# Refined Artifact #1 - *The Race*
I created *The Race* in November of 2018 and completed the quick game in December of 2018. It was intended to be my final assignment for my GAM-312 class, Scripting for Games, but I had enjoyed working on it so much that I decided to return to it for my capstone class.

In *The Race*, the goal is to find and collect the hidden items within the level before the mindless AI steal them. There are different kinds of AI, with some running to randomized places and others running around in circles and there are multiple levels with various difficulties; some levels are timed while others are more geared toward exploring. Along with the hidden items are decoy items that will challenge the player into thinking they should go a certain way only to find out that the item was a mirage, allowing the AI more time to steal the real items.
