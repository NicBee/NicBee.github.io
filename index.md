## Nicole Beller: GAM-495 Capstone

# Refined Artifact #1 - *The Race*
I created *The Race* in November of 2018 and completed the quick game in December of 2018. It was intended to be my final assignment for my GAM-312 class, Scripting for Games, but I had enjoyed working on it so much that I decided to return to it for my capstone class.

In *The Race*, the goal is to find and collect the hidden items within the level before the mindless AI steal them. There are different kinds of AI, with some running to randomized places and others running around in circles and there are multiple levels with various difficulties; some levels are timed while others are more geared toward exploring. Along with the hidden items are decoy items that will challenge the player into thinking they should go a certain way only to find out that the item was a mirage, allowing the AI more time to steal the real items.

# Refined Artifact #2 - *Paintball_Fiasco*

*Paintball_Fiasco* is a simple paintball game that I created for my GAM-415 Graphics Game Engine course through February and April of 2019. The game objective is to make as big of a paintball mess as possible. There is no 'win scenario' and it’s more so used to vent frustrations by shooting colorful paintballs all over the place. Players can shoot black walls, animated and non-animated targets, and can shoot while jumping on a trampoline. The goal of the game was to make something fun for my son, who is six years old, to enjoy and not worry about losing.

# Refined Artifact #3 - *The Imaginarium*

*The Imaginarium* is a 3D adventure single-player game. The game is about a child named Sam who needs to pick up and put away his toys but with each toy collected Sam becomes bored and begins to daydream. When Sam’s imagination runs wild, they believe they’re in a castle instead and that they need to navigate their way over the lava pits and jump puzzles, fight the bad guys, and find the hidden keys to open the locked doors.  Once they pass all of their challenges, they can return the toy to the chest, which will kick them out of their imagination and bring them back to the real world.

*The Imaginarium* was created by Team (Pizz)A, which consisted of 6 individuals; each individual had their role on the team, with me being the primary main character programmer and the UI programmer, along with finding and utilizing the various audio cues and I was the occasional QA.  Under the guidance of our GAM-305 (Digital Game Development) professor, we won the competition that he had started that term in January and February of 2019.

# Refined Artifact #4 - *Bandit's Endeavour*
![Bandit's Endeavour](https://github.com/NicBee/NicBee.github.io/blob/master/Bandits_Endeavour_8.jpg?raw=true "Bandit's Endeavour")

I created this Flash animation in the spring of 2018 (March - April) and I didn't revisit it until October of 2019.  I created this animation for my GRA-211 Interactive Animation course and I always believed I would return to it because I  thoroughly enjoyed working on it.  I also enjoyed knowing that I was using a program that some well-known animated sitcoms were created with.

*Bandit's Endeavour* is an animation about a feline who hates his life.  Mistreated and neglected, Bandit aimlessly waits for a time when he can escape.  Eventually, the lovely Shiloh approaches Bandit with an offer.  Watch as Bandit and Shiloh team up and escape from the Crazy Cat Lady's lair.
