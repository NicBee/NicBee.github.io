### **Skills Learned**
  - Display 3D objects in game development environments by employing graphics application program interfaces
  - Apply texture and material to meshes adding 2D images to 3D models
  - Apply shaders to geometric objects in game development environments by employing graphics application program interfaces
  - Relate graphics application program interfaces to the output of graphic game engines for making informed game project decisions
  - Differentiate among graphics application program interfaces in examining current trends in game engine architecture
  
 ### **Highlighted Skills**
  - Game Engine Mastery: showcases that I can use programming along with blueprints, shaders, and plugins within the Unreal Engine.  I consider it mastery becasue there aren't a lot of tutorials for C++/VS online for UE4, which means it can be considered hard to learn and understand.
  - 3D Graphics: showcases my basic shapes.  Anyone can click and drag a square or sphere from the side, but it takes skill and dedication to learn how to script a square or sphere from scratch.
  - Programming: showcases my interest and talent in coding.  Since most of the objects and actors were created from scratch by using C++ and Visual Studio, the game shows that I have a deep understanding of how C++ works with the Unreal Engine.
