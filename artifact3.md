 ### **Highlighted Skills**
  - Graphic Interface Design: showcases the UI work I put into this game.  I did all of the menus, ensuring the buttons functioned properly, the text was legible and well-written, and made sure the user input worked.  I also developed and filmed the ending 'win' scene and used blueprints to connect the different mapes together.
  - Game Physics: showcases that I understand how physics works, by the AI moving, doors swinging open, chests opening, player jumping and moving, elevator functioning, etc
  - Complex Logic Problem Solution: showcases that I can QA and debug.  I got rid of all of the bugs that the original game had like the elevator-clipping issue and the non-attacking AI.
  - Audio: showcases that I have an ear for audio and know how to trigger sound effects and audio appropriately.  I utilized different ways to trigger the audio.
