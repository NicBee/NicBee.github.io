 - Various YouTube Tutorials
 
### **Inclusion**

The moment my team completed this game, I knew I was going to add this to my ePortfolio. I am beyond proud of what we accomplished and I want to share this game with as many people as I can. It has a unique story, it can appeal to many different audiences, it has a good balance between being not-too-difficult but also not-too-easy, it’s replayable, it has a great level layout, and the game has a comedic charm to it. I feel like this is the game that I will return to, to fix up and improve upon by adding new imaginative levels, bigger challenges, collectibles, and non-playable characters; I will also add dialogue, an inventory system, personally created 3D models, etc.
 
Specifically, I added this game to my ePortfolio to show off what I was able to accomplish while on a team. My team consisted of very different people with opposing personalities and I oftentimes found myself to be the mediator for the team. We went through a lot in our nearly 7 weeks together and I am beyond impressed with myself and them for what we were able to accomplish.

As a sometimes dysfunctional team, I had to rely on my skills and eye for design when creating the menus because my team very rarely ever gave me any feedback. Every image in the Main Menu section was created by me, by manipulating the level layout and moving characters to where I needed them. I believe I helped set the tone for the game through the level-manipulated images because I helped the team see the potential in our game whenever they were feeling discouraged.

This quick video shows a piece of my personality that I added to the game:

### **Skills Learned**
  - Assess the software development life cycle of game projects for determining key factors that influence effectively programmed team developments
  - Select appropriate tools and techniques for addressing functionality in game programming project scope and development
  - Analyze gaps in how game design documentation is converted into programming code for drawing informed conclusions about game projects
  - Apply formal testing methodologies for identifying and correcting program bugs and accuracy relative to game design specifications
  - Assess collaborative strategies for their ability to promote effective communication in team-based game programming projects
  
### **Highlighted Skills**
  - Graphic Interface Design: showcases the UI work I put into this game.  I did all of the menus, ensuring the buttons functioned properly, the text was legible and well-written, and made sure the user input worked.  I also developed and filmed the ending 'win' scene and used blueprints to connect the different mapes together.
  - Game Physics: showcases that I understand how physics works, by the AI moving, doors swinging open, chests opening, player jumping and moving, elevator functioning, etc
  - Complex Logic Problem Solution: showcases that I can QA and debug.  I got rid of all of the bugs that the original game had like the elevator-clipping issue and the non-attacking AI.
  - Audio: showcases that I have an ear for audio and know how to trigger sound effects and audio appropriately.  I utilized different ways to trigger the audio.
   
### **Revised Components**
- Graphic Interface Design
- Game Physics
- Complex Logic Problem Solving
- Audio

Working on this artifact made me insanely happy. I think GAM-305 was one of my favorite classes because I felt like I learned something and it revalidated my choice in getting my degree in Game Programming and Development. I had a blast working with my team and I would love to be able to work with them again. Going back to the game, I finally had the chance to see what my teammates did. I noticed that one of the programmers was very good about leaving comments in his blueprints while the other neglected to leave any. Fixing some of the blueprints became difficult because sometimes I wasn’t sure what my teammate was trying to accomplish due to the lack of comments.

Despite my team winning a competition with this game, I was fully aware of a game-breaking bug that my team didn’t have time to fix: elevator clipping. When the player would go near the elevator and hop out when the elevator was going on, the player would clip the edge of the floor and would fall out of the level. The only way to ‘fix’ that issue in-game would be to exit out of the game and try again. I fixed this by adding a floor underneath the elevator. Now if a player steps off, they don’t fall to their doom.

Another thing I improved is I updated the UI and audio. Back then I was in a rush to get my job done because we had little time to accomplish anything so I just threw everything together. This time, I changed the HUD energy box and rearranged the HUD layout. I also added a health bar above the AI because it seemed like it was taking forever to defeat the bad guys during gameplay, so I wanted to show the player that they were damaging the enemies. I even increased the AI’s running speed so now they catch up to you and add more of a challenge.

Overall, I think my team did a great job on what they worked on and it was easy to go back in and fix up what needed to be fixed or adjusted. While working on this artifact, I did learn that there’s a great way to leave comments in blueprints. Instead of just leaving a rough explanation of what’s going on, I could individually explain each node or group, which makes it a lot easier to understand. For example, one of my teammates likes to leave comments like this:
 
  ![Teammate Blueprint](https://github.com/NicBee/NicBee.github.io/blob/master/TheImaginarium_6.JPG?raw=true "Teammate Blueprint")

The only real challenge I faced when working on this artifact was deciding what I should do to improve it. I remembered there being an issue with the AI and I couldn’t recall what it was until I was doing a playthrough and realized I could just breeze past all of them, which is why I increased their running speed. I also increased the damage output of the ranged AI because they rarely ever hit me, so when they did, I wanted it to make an impact, to add more of a challenge to the game. I also remembered the elevator-clipping issue, but that was an easy fix. Everything else to improve the game was cosmetic.

Out of all of the artifacts in my ePortfolio, I feel like this is my best and strongest one and I think it’s because we each brought something unique to the team. I also discovered that I enjoy doing UI work, so I was excited to work on this project every time. It made me realize that I want to work on another team and not be a solo game designer.

This video shows some of the work that I put into this game.  It shows the various audio tracks I used that were triggered in different ways (player's location, being attacked, being hit, chests opening, pickups, etc); it also shows the HUD being updated, the AI health bar and also displays a little bit of interactivity between the game and the user based on the text that appears above the chests:
